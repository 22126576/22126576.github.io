<p>Website Development<p>
   
<p>Unit Introduction:<p>

<p>Have you ever viewed a website and wondered how it was created? Many different
elements can be included in the website, such as text, graphics, animation, video and
programs (client-side computer scripts). Many websites also contain sophisticated
interactive features such as database search facilities, online purchasing and
messaging. To be successful, a website must be visually interesting, while remaining
easy to use.<br>

With the internet being central to how most organisations and individuals
communicate and do business, the creation and maintenance of websites is an
important job role. There is a strong demand in the job market for web developers
with appropriate technical and creative skills. For instance, a web-developer is a
technical role involved with designing and developing websites, a content manager
is responsible for keeping a website up to date and a search engine optimisation
specialist encourages user traffic from internet search engines to specific websites.
In this unit, you will investigate the features and uses of websites by exploring what
they are and how their integrated components and applications interact with each
other.<br>

You will also learn how to design, develop and test a website for a brief. Once this
is completed you will review your website, having obtained feedback from others.
In particular this unit develops skills from Unit 1: The Online World and Unit 2:
Technology Systems. It also develops the skills from the following units: Unit 4:
Creating Digital Animation, Unit 5: Creating Digital Audio, Unit 6: Creating Digital
Graphics, and Unit 7: Creating Digital Video. Unit 12: Software Development could
also complement the content of this unit.<p>   
   
<p>Below I have included a screen recording of my finished website showing it all the way through. Below that you can find a button that will take you to a further explanation on my work as well as an example of the documentation I made when making the website.
