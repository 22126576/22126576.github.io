<p>Technology Systems<p>

<p>Unit Introduction:<p>

Technology systems are involved in many of the objects we use every day, from
a laptop computer and routers relaying internet traffic, to logging in to a social
networking site. This unit provides a first look at how the main building blocks of
technology systems work.
<br>You will explore the common hardware components of technology systems, such as
a touch screen or a printer, and the internal building blocks of a computer like the
processor, buses and memory. The unit also covers the purpose of networks, which
allow different devices within a technology system to communicate. (This topic is
covered in more detail in Unit 1: The Online World and Unit 11: Computer Networks.)
No technology system is complete without the software that brings it to life. You will
explore different types of software. These will include the operating system (OS) that
supports the communication and management of resources, and utility programs that
provide functionality to maintain the system.
You will also learn about the role of applications software, such as office programs,
graphics packages, accounting software and CAD/CAM, that supports many aspects
of everyday business life.
<br>This unit is particularly useful if you are considering a career in the IT sector,
as it includes key concepts and processes which form the basis of any technology
system and is relevant for many roles in the industry.<p>
<p>Assessment Overview<br><br>
Assessment is via on online test after covering all the different topics in this unit to evaluate our grade. This test was mostly multiple choice with a writing task at the end.<p>

<ul>
	<li>Technology systems in different sectors</li>
	<li>Computing Devices</li>
	<li>Input and Output Devices</li>
	<li>Storage Devices</li>
	<li>Automated Technology Systems</li>
	<li>Types of Computer Networks</li>
	<li>Developments in Technology</li>
	<li>Issues with Technology Systems</li>

	<li>Internal Components</li>
	<li>Computer Performance Factors</li>
</ul>

<p>Below is an example of a retired test paper we used to revise for the real test. Using these for revision aswell as using the information available to us on Google Classroom made the test much easier.<p>
