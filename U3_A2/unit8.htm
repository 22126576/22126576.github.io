<p>Mobile App Development<p>
   
<p>Unit Introduction:<p>
<p> How many people do you know who have smartphones or mobile tablet devices? This
means that they are carrying considerable computer power around with them. There
has been an explosion of software applications, known as apps, to use on these
devices. You can use apps for many different purposes; for example, a location app
helps you to find your nearest shop, and a leisure app makes it easy to download
your favourite music.
<br>
Software developers and engineers have scrambled to meet the demand for mobile
apps, that are increasingly being used by businesses and organisations. The market
for Apple, Android and other apps have boomed. Software engineers are involved
with the design, development, testing and maintenance of apps. In addition, software
businesses that develop apps employ other professionals, including creative
designers, artists and sound engineers.
<br>
In this unit you will investigate the characteristics and uses of mobile apps, and learn
how mobile apps are developed. Then you will design, develop, test and review your
own mobile app. Rather than producing large amounts of original code from scratch,
the emphasis in this unit is on you integrating predefined programs/code snippets
(specific instructions for a mobile computer) with ready-made and original assets
(e.g. buttons and sounds) by using some original code. This will save you significant
amounts of time when developing your mobile app. You will review your finished app,
having obtained feedback from others, and evaluate possible improvements.
You may even be able to get it published on the internet and take pride in people
using an app you made.
<p>



<p>Below I have included a screen recording of my finished app showing it all the way through to the complete screen. Below that you can find a button that will take you to a further explanation on my work as well as an example of the documentation I made when making the app.
